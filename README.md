## 🎉 IMMEDIATE TESTING WORKFLOW

### 1. Start as Student:
```
1. Login with: rddadarsh@gmail.com / 123456
2. Select any engineering stream (all 5 work!)
3. Choose any subject (all have 10+ questions)
4. Take a complete exam (8 MCQ + 2 Descriptive)
5. Get instant AI-powered results
6. View detailed performance analytics
```

### 2. Check as Admin:
```
1. Login with: adarshreddy532@gmail.com / admin123
2. View platform statistics (all 5 streams)
3. Check results management (filter, export)
4. Monitor AI system status
5. Manage users and settings
```

### 3. Verify AI System:
```
🤖 AI Status Indicators:
   ✅ "SBERT AI Evaluation Ready" = Working perfectly
   📝 "Enhanced Manual Evaluation Mode" = AI fallback active
   ⏳ "Initializing AI Evaluation..." = Loading model
```

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If SBERT Shows Error:
1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - Model needs time to download
2. **Check internet** - Required for initial model download
3. **Use Chrome** - Best WebGL support for TensorFlow.js
4. **Clear cache** - Refresh page if loading issues
5. **Check console** - F12 for detailed error messages

**No worries if AI fails - Manual evaluation works excellently!**

### Common Issues:
```
❓ Port already in use?
   → Try: python3 -m http.server 3000

❓ Python not found?
   → Install Python 3.8+ from python.org

❓ SBERT not loading?
   → Manual evaluation still works perfectly

❓ Results not showing?
   → Check browser console (F12) for errors
```
