The interaction between the rotating stator field and rotor current produces torque, causing the rotor to rotate in the same direction as the magnetic field. The rotor speed is always less than the synchronous speed, creating slip which is necessary for torque production.",
        "explanation": "Induction motors operate through electromagnetic induction between stator and rotor."

        "question": "Describe the construction and working of a single-phase transformer.",
        "answer": "A single-phase transformer consists of two windings - primary and secondary - wound on a common magnetic core made of laminated silicon steel. When AC voltage is applied to the primary winding, it creates alternating magnetic flux in the core. This changing flux links with the secondary winding and induces EMF according to Faraday's law. The voltage transformation ratio depends on the turns ratio between primary and secondary windings. Step-up transformers have more secondary turns while step-down transformers have fewer secondary turns. The transformer operates on mutual inductance principle and provides electrical isolation between circuits.",
        "explanation": "Transformers use electromagnetic induction to transfer energy between circuits through a magnetic core."
